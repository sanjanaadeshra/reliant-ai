This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/datatable](http://localhost:3000/datatable) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Application Information

You can refer to the api added with [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) details in order to fetch the table information. 
The thought process behing adding this is to make sure the data is in a format suitable for the UI team to utilise.
